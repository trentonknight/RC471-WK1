    \section{Childhood}
When I was very young my parents began teaching me to read. I would spend a large portion of my time reading from the bible due to the frequency of our studies. My mother also at an early age would read the bible but did not become a Jehovah's Witness until near her teenage years. My father on the other hand went to more Mainline Protestant type churches and converted later to become a Jehovahs Witness. Die to the rigorous readings each week I could read and write at a very early age as could my younger brother and sister.
